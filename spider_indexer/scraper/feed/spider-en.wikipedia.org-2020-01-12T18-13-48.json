The origin of the name   itself derives from the   word   (field). In some languages, such as Hungarian, Lithuanian, Persian and Turkish, the country's   is derived from the   (  or  ),  a   tribe, which dwelled on the south-eastern most edge of present-day  , in the   between the 7th and 11th centuries \u2014 lands which were part of the territorial domain ruled over by the Polans. Their name derives from the Proto-Slavic and   word   (open land or plain). \n The early   in Poland begun around 2400 BC, while the   commenced in approximately 700 BC.  During this time, the  , spanning both the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent. The most famous archaeological find from   is the   fortified settlement (now reconstructed as an open-air museum), dating from the Lusatian culture of the late Bronze Age, around 748 BC. \n Throughout the   period, many distinct ancient ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now Poland in an era that dates from about 400 BC to 500 AD. These groups are identified as  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   tribes. Also, recent archeological findings in the   region, confirmed the presence of the   on the territory of Poland.  These were most likely expeditionary missions sent out to protect the   trade. The exact time and routes of the original migration and settlement of   lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented.  The   tribes who would form Poland migrated to these areas in the second half of the 5th century AD. Up until the creation of   state and his subsequent conversion to Christianity in 966 AD, the main religion of West Slavic tribes that inhabited the geographical area of present-day Poland was  .

The clash between Boles\u0142aw III and Henry V was documented by   in  .  In 1138, Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when Boles\u0142aw divided his lands among his sons. In 1226,  , one of the regional   dukes, invited the   to help him fight the     pagans; a decision that led to centuries of warfare with the Knights. In 1264, the   or the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous right for the Jews in Poland, leading to a nearly autonomous \"nation within a nation\". \n In the middle of the 13th century, the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty (  and  , ruled 1238\u20131241) nearly succeeded in uniting the Polish lands, but the   invaded the country from the east and defeated the combined Polish forces at the   where Duke Henry II the Pious died. In 1320, after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms,   consolidated his power, took the throne and became the first king of  . His son,   (reigned 1333\u20131370), has a reputation as one of the greatest Polish kings, and gained wide recognition for improving the country's infrastructure.  He also extended royal protection to  , and encouraged their immigration to Poland.  Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to create an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when   granted him permission to open the  .\n The   of the nobles began to develop under Casimir's rule, when in return for their  , the king made a series of concessions to the nobility, and establishing their legal status as superior to that of the townsmen. When Casimir the Great died in 1370, leaving no legitimate male heir, the   came to an end.\n During the 13th and 14th centuries, Poland became a destination for German, Flemish and to a lesser extent Walloon, Danish and Scottish migrants. Also, Jews and Armenians began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era (see   and  ).\n The  , a plague that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not significantly affect Poland, and the country was spared from a major outbreak of the disease.  The reason for this was the decision of Casimir the Great to quarantine the nation's borders.\n The   spanned the late   and early   of Polish history. Beginning with the     (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o), the Jagiellon dynasty (1386\u20131572) formed the  . The partnership brought vast  -controlled   into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest   in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region the struggle of Poland and Lithuania with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated in the   (1410), where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against them.  In 1466, after the  , King   gave royal consent to the  , which created the future  , a Polish vassal. The Jagiellon dynasty at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of   (1471 onwards) and  .  In the south, Poland confronted the   and the   (by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569),  and in the east helped Lithuania fight the  . Some historians estimate that Crimean Tatar slave-raiding cost Poland-Lithuania one million of its population between the years of 1494 and 1694. \n Poland was developing as a   state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful  . The   act adopted by the Polish   (parliament) in 1505, transferred most of the   from the monarch to the Sejm, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as \"Golden Liberty\", when the state was ruled by the \"free and equal\"  .   movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time.  This tolerance allowed the country to avoid most of the religious turmoil that spread over Europe during the 16th century. \n The European   evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings   and  ) a sense of urgency in the need to promote a  , and during this period Polish culture and the nation's economy flourished. In 1543,  , an astronomer from  , published his epochal work   ( ), and thereby became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the  , which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy. Another major figure associated with the era is the classicist poet  . \n The 1569   established the  , a more closely unified federal state with an  , but which was governed largely by the nobility, through a system of   with a central parliament. The   (1573) guaranteed religious freedom for the Polish nobility   and townsfolk  . However, the     were still subject to severe limitations imposed on them by the nobility.  The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in Poland, with the union thereafter becoming a European power and a major cultural entity, occupying approximately one million square kilometers of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as an agent for the dissemination of   through   into areas of modern-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus and Western Russia.\n In the 16th and 17th centuries,   suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the   kings   and   and found itself engaged in major conflicts with  , Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, as well as a series of minor   uprisings.  In 1610, a Polish army under command     seized Moscow after winning the  . In 1611, the Tsar of Russia   to the King of Poland.\n After the signing of  , Poland had in the years 1618\u20131621 an area of about 1\u00a0million\u00a0km  (390,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\n From the middle of the 17th century, the nobles' democracy, suffering from internal disorder, gradually declined, thereby leaving the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention. Starting in 1648, the     engulfed the south and east, eventually leaving Ukraine divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the  , a Swedish invasion of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure\u2014around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics throughout the 17th century.  However, under   the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the   against the  , commanded by  , the Grand Vizier of the  .\n Sobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g.   against   and rebellious  ) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of  , and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the    ,   and  , as well as the rise of   and   after the   only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight. Despite this The Commonwealth-Saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth's first reform movement, and laid the foundations for the  . \n During the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms; with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy, significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced   (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n The   of 1764 resulted in the elevation of   (a Polish aristocrat connected to the   faction of  ) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress  , the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768  , a   rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the   by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \" \", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\"  .  Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the  , the first government education authority in Europe. Corporal punishment of children was officially prohibited in 1783.\n The   convened by Stanis\u0142aw II August in 1788 successfully adopted the  , the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe. However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the  , an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the  .\n The defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the  , which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. Eventually, in 1795, following the failed  , the Commonwealth was   by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist. \n Poles  , particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in 1794 during the  , where a popular and distinguished general  , who had several years earlier served under   in the  , led Polish insurrectionists against numerically superior Russian forces. Despite the victory at the  , his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence  . \n In 1807,   temporarily recreated a Polish state as the satellite  , after a successful   against Prussian rule. But, after the failed  , Poland was again split between the victorious powers at the   of 1815.  The eastern part was ruled by the Russian   as  , which had a  . However, over time the Russian monarch reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled  , and particularly the  , allowed free Polish culture to flourish.\n Throughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments. In 1830, the   began in Warsaw when, led by Lieutenant  , young   at the   in Warsaw revolted. They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.\n Over the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal   and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General  , many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire. \n During the   (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the   to resist Prussian rule. Initially, the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience, but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region. Eventually, after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the Prussians, and the   was more completely incorporated into Prussia. \n In 1863, a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began. The   started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against   into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement. Congress Poland was rapidly industrialised towards the end of the 19th century, and successively transformed into the Empire's wealthiest and most developed subject. \n Despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity. This was particularly true in Greater Poland, Silesia and Eastern Pomerania controlled by Prussia (later becoming a part of the  ); areas which eventually, thanks largely to the   and  , were reconstituted as a part of the  , becoming the country's most prosperous regions. \n During  , all the   agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President   proclaimed in Point 13 of his  . A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Shortly after the  , Poland regained its independence as the   ( ). It reaffirmed its independence after  , the most notable being the   (1919\u201321) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the   at the  , an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced   to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism. The event is often referred to as the \"Miracle at the Vistula\". \n During this period, Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state. Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards   instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a   was opened on the   Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged  .\n The inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as   (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when  , inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the   Gallery in Warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist  . \n In 1926, a  , led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal  , turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan   ( ) movement in an effort to prevent radical political organizations on both the left and the right from destabilizing the country.  The movement functioned integrally until Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935. Following Marshall Pi\u0142sudski's death, Sanation split into several competing factions.  By the late 1930s, Poland's government had become increasingly rigid; with a number of radical political parties that threatened the stability of the country such as the   banned. \n As a subsequent result of the   in 1938, Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland the small 350 sq mi   region. The area was a point of contention between the Polish and Czechoslovak governments in the past and the two countries  . \n  began with the     on 1 September 1939, followed by the   on 17 September.

The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 it initiated  , of which the   that begun on 1 August 1944 is the best known operation. \n Nazi German forces under orders from   set up six German   in occupied Poland, including  ,   and  .

Around 150,000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviets between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union's occupation of eastern Poland ( ), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were murdered by the   (UPA) between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the  .    in the war, Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens: around 6 million perished \u2013 more than one-sixth of Poland's pre-war population \u2013   Polish Jews.  About 90% of deaths were non-military in nature. \n In 1945, Poland's borders  . Over two million Polish inhabitants of     along the   by Stalin.  The western border became the  . As a result, Poland's territory was reduced by 20%, or 77,500 square kilometres (29,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The shift forced the migration of  , most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews. \n At the insistence of  , the   sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the   based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a   by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to   and   that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new   government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the  .  , the Soviet occupation of Poland met with   from the outset which continued into the Fifties.\n Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland  (in particular the cities of   and  ) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of   units on Poland's territory.

As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered declines in social and economic standards,  but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels, which it achieved by 1995 thanks largely to its booming economy. \n Most visibly, there were numerous improvements in human rights, such as  ,   (no censorship), civil liberties (1st class) and political rights (1st class), as ranked by   non-governmental organization.

The next highest mountain groups are the   in the  , the highest point of which is   at 1,603 metres (5,259\u00a0ft), and the  , the highest point of which is   at 1,425 metres (4,675\u00a0ft).\n Other notable uplands include the  , which are noted for their interesting rock formations, the   in the far southeast of the country, in which the highest Polish peak is   at 1,346 metres (4,416\u00a0ft), the   in  , whose highest point is   at 1,310 metres (4,298\u00a0ft), the   in  , the highest point of which is Wysokie Ska\u0142ki (Wysoka) at 1,050 metres (3,445\u00a0ft), and the   in  , which have two similarly high peaks:   at 612 metres (2,008\u00a0ft) and   at 593 metres (1,946\u00a0ft).\n The lowest point in Poland \u2013 at 1.8 metres (5.9\u00a0ft) below sea level \u2013 is at  , near   in the Vistula Delta.\n In the   (the Coal Fields of  ) region in the   in southern Poland is an area of sparsely vegetated sand known as the  . It covers an area of 32 square kilometres (12\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is not a natural desert but results from human activity from the   onwards.\n The Baltic Sea activity in   created   which in the course of time separated the bay from the sea creating two lakes. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a rate of 3 to 10 metres (9.8 to 32.8\u00a0ft) per year. Some dunes reach the height of up to 30 metres (98\u00a0ft). The highest peak of the park is Rowokol (115 metres or 377 feet  ).\n The longest rivers are the   ( :  ), 1,047 kilometres (651\u00a0mi) long; the   ( :  ) which forms part of Poland's western border, 854 kilometres (531\u00a0mi) long; its tributary, the  , 808 kilometres (502\u00a0mi) long; and the  , a tributary of the Vistula, 772 kilometres (480\u00a0mi) long. The Vistula and the Oder flow into the  , as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania. \n The   and the   flow by way of the   to the Baltic Sea, and the   flows into the Baltic Sea through the  . While the great majority of Poland's rivers drain into the Baltic Sea, Poland's Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the  , which flows via the   and the   to the  . The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the   to the Black Sea.\n Poland's rivers have been used since early times for navigation. The  , for example, traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their  . In the Middle Ages and in early modern times, when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe;  the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward   and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance. \n In the valley of   river in   there is a unique natural   of water containing calcium salts, that is an object of protection in   in  . The origin of the name of the reserve  , that means  , comes from the fact that red waves are absorbed by water and only blue and green are reflected from the bottom of the spring, giving that atypical colour. \n With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than 1 hectare (2.47 acres) each, Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world. In Europe, only   has a greater density of lakes.  The largest lakes, covering more than 100 square kilometres (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), are   and   in  , and   and   in  .\n In addition to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania,  , Lubuskie, and  ), there are also many mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area. The lake with the greatest depth\u2014of more than 100 metres (328\u00a0ft)\u2014is   in the Wigry Lake District, east of Masuria in  .\n Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District. The   settlement of  , occupied by more than one thousand residents, was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the  .\n Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to today's modern Polish society. The ancestors of today's Poles, the  , built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes. The legendary Prince   ruled from   tower erected on the  .  The first historically documented ruler of Poland, Duke  , had his palace on an island in the Warta River in  . Nowadays the Polish lakes provide a location for the pursuit of water sports such as   and  .\n The Polish Baltic coast is approximately 528 kilometres (328\u00a0mi) long and extends from   on the islands of   and   in the west to   on the   in the east. For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual   and   has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as \u0141ebsko Lake in S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park.\n The largest spits are   and the  . The coast line is varied also by   and   and a few lakes, e.g.   and  . The largest Polish Baltic island is called   known for its  . The largest sea   are  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   and the main coastal resorts \u2013  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and the Hel Peninsula.\n Forests cover about 30.5% of Poland's land area based on international standards.  Its overall percentage is still increasing.   are managed by the national program of reforestation (KPZL), aiming at an increase of forest-cover to 33% in 2050. The richness of Polish forest (per SoEF 2011 statistics)  is more than twice as high as European average (with Germany and France at the top), containing 2.304 billion cubic metres of trees.  The largest forest complex in Poland is  .\n More than 1% of Poland's territory, 3,145 square kilometres (1,214\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), is protected within 23  . Three more national parks are projected for  , the Polish Jura, and the eastern  . In addition,   along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected, as are coastal areas in the north. There are over 120 areas designated as  , along with numerous   and other   (e.g.  ).\n Since Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, Polish agriculture has performed extremely well and the country has over two million private farms.  It is the leading producer in Europe of potatoes and   (world's second largest in 1989) the world's largest producer of  ,  and one of the more important producers of barley, oats,  , flax, and fruits. Poland is the European Union's fourth largest supplier of pork after Germany, Spain and France. \n , Poland belongs to the Central European province of the   within the  . According to the  , the territory of   of the continental forest spanning Central and Northern European   ecoregions as well as the Carpathian   conifer forest.\n Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland, such as the   in the   of the   and in  . Other such species include the   in  , in the Tatras, and in the Beskids, the   and the   in various forests, the   in northern Poland, and the   in Masuria, Pomerania, and Podlaskie.\n In the forests there are game animals, such as  ,   and  . In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands, like Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest, that have never been cleared or disturbed much by people. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, Masuria, Pomerania,   and  .\n Poland is the most important breeding ground for a variety of European  .  One quarter of the global population of   (40,000 breeding pairs) live in Poland,  particularly in the lake districts and the wetlands along the  , the  , and the  , which are part of nature reserves or national parks.\n Poland has historically been home to the two largest European species of mammals \u2014   ( ) and   ( ). Both survived in Poland longer than anywhere else. The last aurochs of Europe became extinct in 1627, in the  , while   survived until the   only in the  , but have been reintroduced to other countries since.\n The climate is mostly   throughout the country. The climate is   in the north and west and becomes gradually warmer and   towards the south and east. Summers are generally warm, with average temperatures between 18 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4 and 86.0\u00a0\u00b0F) depending on the region. Winters are rather cold, with average temperatures around 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in the northwest and \u22126\u00a0\u00b0C (21\u00a0\u00b0F) in the northeast.   falls throughout the year, although, especially in the east, winter is drier than summer. \n The warmest region in Poland is   in the southwest of the country, where temperatures in the summer average between 24 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C (75 and 90\u00a0\u00b0F) but can go as high as 34 to 39\u00a0\u00b0C (93.2 to 102.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on some days in the warmest months of July and August. The warmest cities in Poland are   in  , and   in Lower Silesia. The average temperatures in Wroc\u0142aw are 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) in the summer and 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32.0\u00a0\u00b0F) in the winter, but   has the longest summer in all of Poland, which lasts for 115 days, from mid-May to mid-September. The coldest region of Poland is in the northeast in the   near the borders with   and  . Usually the coldest city is  . The climate is affected by   which come from   and  . The average temperature in the winter in Podlaskie ranges from \u22126 to \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C (21 to 25\u00a0\u00b0F). The biggest impact of the   is observed in   and   seashore area from   to  . \n Poland is a  , with a   as a  , whose current   dates from 1997.  The government structure centers on the  , led by a  . The president appoints the cabinet according to the proposals of the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the  . The president is elected by popular vote every five years. The current   is   and the   is  . \n Polish voters elect a   parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house (Sejm) and a 100-member Senate ( ). The Sejm is elected under   according to the  , a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems. The Senat, on the other hand, is elected under the   method, with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies. \n With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of   receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senat form the   (the  ). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: when a new president takes the  ; when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal ( ); and when a president's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared. To date only the first instance has occurred. \n The   plays an important role in decision-making. Its major institutions include the   ( ); the   ( ); the   ( ); and the   ( ). On the approval of the Senat, the Sejm also appoints the   or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection ( ) for a five-year term. The ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish citizens and residents, of the law and of principles of community life and social justice. \n The   is the supreme law in contemporary Poland, and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of Civil Law. Historically, the most famous Polish legal act is the  . Historian   describes it as the first of its kind in Europe.  The Constitution was instituted as a   ( :  ) and then adopted on 3 May 1791 by the   of the  . Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the   Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and its  . Previously only the   signed by each of Poland's elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws.\n The new Constitution introduced political equality between   and the   ( ), and placed the   under the protection of the government. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the  , which at one time had placed the   at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be   by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's    , with a more   and democratic  . The adoption of   was treated as a threat by Poland's neighbours.  In response  , Austria and Russia formed an anti-Polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to   their weaker neighbour and destroyed the Polish state. In the words of two of its co-authors,   and  , the constitution represented \"the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland.\" Despite this, its text influenced many later   across the globe.  In Poland, freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Article 25 (section I. The Republic) and Article 54 (section II. The Freedoms, Rights and Obligations of Persons and Citizens) of the  .\n  started in the 1800s in the age of the foreign Partitions. Poland's precursor of feminism,  , founded a group of   in 1842. Prior to the   in 1795, tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life. Since 1918, following the return to independence, all women could vote. Poland was the 15th (12th sovereign) country to introduce universal women's suffrage. Currently, in Poland abortion is allowed only in special circumstances, such as when the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy, when the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act, or when the fetus is seriously malformed.  Homosexuality in Poland was confirmed as legal in 1932. Also, Poland recognises gender change.  Trafficking women is 'illegal and rare' (top results worldwide). \n Poland's current constitution was adopted by the   on 2 April 1997, approved by a national referendum on 25 May 1997, and came into effect on 17 October 1997. It guarantees a multi-party state, the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly, and specifically casts off many Communist ideals to create a '   '. It requires public officials to pursue ecologically sound public policy and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and to strike, whilst at the same time prohibiting the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture and corporal punishment.\n In recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and many 'developing' countries.\n Poland is a member of the  ,  , the  , the  , the   (OECD),  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  .\n In 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the   (WEU), having submitted preliminary documentation for full membership in 1996, it formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the  . In 1996, Poland achieved full   membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the   (NATO) in the first wave of   finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.\n As changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the  . Poland has forged a special relationships with  ,  with whom it co-hosted the UEFA   football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the  . Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the  ; this is particularly true of  , where in 2005 the   regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority. \n Poland is the   of the European Union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the  . Ever since joining the union in 2004, successive Polish governments have pursued policies to increase the country's role in European and regional affairs.\n Poland's current   (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than 10,000 square kilometres (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) for Opole Voivodeship to more than 35,000 square kilometres (14,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed   (governor), an elected regional assembly ( ) and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by that assembly.\n The voivodeships are subdivided into   (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into   (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both   and  . Poland has 16 voivodeships, 380 powiats (including 66 cities with   status), and 2,478  .\n The Polish armed forces are composed of five branches:   ( ),   ( ),   ( ),   ( ) and   ( ) \u2013 a military component of the Polish armed forces created of 2016. Plans call for the force, once fully active, to consist of 53,000 people who will be trained and equipped to counter potential   threats.  The military is subordinate to the  . However, its commander-in-chief is the President of the Republic.\n The Polish army's size is estimated at around 101,500 soldiers (2016). The Polish Navy primarily operates in the Baltic Sea and conducts operations such as maritime patrol, search and rescue for the section of the Baltic under Polish sovereignty, as well as hydrographic measurements and research. Also, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the  , providing logistical support for the  . The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in   assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in  , has seen no active combat. In 2003, the   Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006.\n The most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad.  Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with   and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military.  The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed. Compulsory military service for men was discontinued in 2008. From 2007, until conscription ended in 2008, the mandatory service was nine months. \n Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners. From 1953 to 2009 Poland was a large contributor to various United Nations peacekeeping missions.  The Polish Armed Forces took part in the  , deploying 2,500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17-nation  .\n The military was temporarily, but severely, affected by the  , which killed the Chief of the Army's General Staff   and Air Force commanding general  , among others. \n Currently, Poland's military is going through a significant modernization phase, which will be completed in 2022. The government plans to spend up to 130 billion z\u0142oty (US$34 billion), however the final total may reach 235 billion z\u0142oty (US$62 billion) to replace dated equipment and purchase new weapons systems.  Under the program, the military plans to purchase new tracked  , self-propelled  ,   and   helicopters, a mid-range   system,  ,  , and coastal  . Also, the army plans to modernize its existing inventory of  , and update its stock of  .  Poland is currently spending 2% of its GDP on defense, and is expected to grow to 2.5% of GDP by 2030. In May 2017 the   has assured that the Polish army will be increased to 250,000 active personnel.\n Poland has a highly developed system of law enforcement with a long history of effective policing by the   (Policja). The structure of law enforcement agencies within Poland is a multi-tier one, with the State Police providing criminal-investigative services,   serving to maintain public order and a number of other specialized agencies, such as the  , acting to fulfill their assigned missions. In addition to these state services, private security companies are also common, although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies, such as, for example, the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect.\n Emergency services in Poland consist of the  ,   units of the   and  . Emergency medical services in Poland are, unlike other services, provided for by local and regional government.\n Since joining the European Union all of Poland's emergency services have been undergoing major restructuring and have, in the process, acquired large amounts of new equipment and staff.  All emergency services personnel are now uniformed and can be easily recognised. In addition, the police and other agencies have been steadily replacing and modernising their fleets of vehicles. \n Poland's economy is considered to be one of the more resilient of the post-Communist countries and is one of the fastest growing within the EU.  Having a strong domestic market, low private debt, low unemployment rate, flexible currency, and not being dependent on a single export sector, Poland is the only European economy to have avoided the  .  Since the  , Poland has pursued a policy   the economy. It is an example of the transition from a   to a primarily  . The country's most successful exports include machinery, furniture, food products, clothing, shoes and cosmetics.  Poland's largest trading partners include Germany, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, France and Italy.  According to   data, Polish GDP per capita in PPS stood at 71% of the EU average in 2018, up from 50% in the year prior to the accession to the EU in 2004. \n The Polish banking sector is the largest in the Central and Eastern European region,  with 32.3 branches per 100,000 adults.  The banks are the largest and most developed sector of the country's  . They are regulated by the  . During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized several banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector more competitive. This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors (ICFI). Poland's banking sector has approximately 5 national banks, a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which make up 68% of the banking capital. \n Poland has many private farms in its agricultural sector, with the potential to become a leading producer of food in the European Union. The biggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate, and dairy products, meats and specialty breads,  with the exchange rate conducive to export growth.  Food exports amounted to 62 billion   in 2011, increasing by 17% from 2010.   Structural reforms in health care, education, the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger-than-expected fiscal pressures. Warsaw leads Central Europe in foreign investment. \n Since the gradual opening of the   labor market from 2004, Poland has had   of over 2.3 million, due to higher wages abroad and mass   at home, even as Poland avoided the   of 2008.  The emigration has increased the average wages for the workers who remained in Poland, in particular for those with intermediate level skills.  Unemployment also gradually decreased; in September 2018 the unemployment rate in Poland was estimated at 5.7%, one of the lowest in the European Union.  In 2019, Poland passed a law that would exempt workers under the age of 26 from income tax. \n Products and goods manufactured in Poland include: electronics, buses and trams ( ,  ), helicopters and planes ( ,  ), trains ( ,  ), ships ( ,  ,  ), military equipment ( ,  ), medicines ( ,  ), food ( ,  ,  ), clothes ( ), glass, pottery ( ), chemical products and others. Poland is also one of the world's biggest producers of  ,   and  , as well as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . \n Poland is recognised as a regional economic leader within Central Europe, with nearly 40 percent of the 500 biggest companies in the region (by revenues) as well as a  .  The country's largest firms compose the   index, which is traded on the  .\n The economic transition in 1989 has resulted in a   in the number and value of investments conducted by Polish corporations abroad. Over a quarter of these companies have participated in a foreign project or  , and 72 percent decided to continue foreign expansion. According to reports made by the  , the value of Polish foreign direct investments reached almost 300 billion   at the end of 2014. The   estimated that in 2014 there were around 1,437 Polish corporations with interests in 3,194 foreign entities. \n Well known Polish brands include, among others  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   (PKP),  , and  . \n The list includes the largest companies by turnover in 2016:\n Poland experienced an increase in the number of tourists after joining the European Union in 2004.  Tourism contributes significantly to the overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country's service market. \n Tourist attractions in Poland vary, from the mountains in the south to the sandy beaches in the north, with a trail of nearly every architectural style. The most visited city is  , which was the former capital of Poland and serves as a relic of   of Renaissance. Krak\u00f3w also held   of  . Among other notable sites in the country is  , one of the oldest cities in Poland. Wroc\u0142aw possesses a huge market square with two  , as well as the oldest   with one of the world's largest number of animal species and is famous for its  . The Polish capital   and its historical   were entirely reconstructed after  .  Other cities attracting tourists include  ,  ,  ,  ,   and the historic site of the     in  .\n Poland's main tourist offerings include outdoor activities such as skiing, sailing, mountain hiking and climbing, as well as agrotourism, sightseeing  . Tourist destinations include the   coast in the north; the   and   in the east; on the south  , the   and the  , where  , the highest peak of Poland, and the famous   mountain trail are located. The   and   lie in the extreme south-east.  There are   in the country, many in the   and along the popular  . \n The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely  \u2013based. Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy. In 2013, Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index.  The three largest Polish coal mining firms ( ,   and  ) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually. All three of these companies are key constituents of the  's lead economic indexes.\n  account for a smaller proportion of Poland's full energy generation capacity.  However, the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 15% in 2020 (in 2017 it was 10.9%). This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of   and a number of   stations.\n Poland has around 164,800,000,000 m  of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as   (\"the only Polish company listed in the  \"),  . However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n The 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are  ,  ,  ,   and  .\n Transport in Poland is provided by means of  ,  ,   and  . Positioned in Central Europe with its eastern and part of its northeastern border constituting the longest land border of the   with the rest of   and  .\n Since joining the EU in May 2004, Poland has invested large amounts of public funds into modernization projects of its transport networks. The country now has a developing network of  , composed of   and  . At the end of 2017, Poland had 3,421.7\u00a0km (2,126.1\u00a0mi) of highways. In addition to these newly built roads, many local and regional roads are being fixed as part of a national programme to rebuild all roads in Poland. \n In 2015, the nation had 19,000 kilometres (11,800\u00a0mi) of railway track. Polish authorities maintain a program of improving operating speeds across the entire Polish rail network. To that end,   (PKP) is adopting new rolling stock which is in principle capable of speeds up to 200\u00a0km/h (124\u00a0mph). Additionally, in December 2014, Poland began to implement   connecting major Polish cities. The Polish government has revealed that it intends to connect all major cities to a future high-speed rail network by 2020.  The new PKP   test train set the record for the fastest train in the history of Poland, reaching 291\u00a0km/h (181\u00a0mph) on 24 November 2013. Poland is gradually implementing the  . Polish regulations allow trains without   to travel at speeds up to 160\u00a0km/h, trains with ETCS1 up to 200\u00a0km/h, and trains with ETCS2 over 200\u00a0km/h. Most interregional connections rail routes in Poland is operated by  , whilst regional trains are run by a number of operators, the largest of which is  .\n On 14 December 2014, Polish State Railways started passenger service using the PKP  , operating at 200\u00a0km/h speed on 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) of line between Olszamowice and Zawiercie (part of the   [CMK]). Currently, the whole CMK and on several other lines is adapted to the speed of 200\u00a0km/h.\n The air and maritime transport markets in Poland are largely well developed. Poland has a number of international airports, the largest of which is  , the primary global hub for  . It was established in 1929 from a merger of   (1922) and   (1925).

The   is the only port in the   adapted to receive oceanic vessels.\n Over the course of history, the Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics.  Perhaps the most renowned Pole to support this theory was   ( ), who triggered the   by placing the  .  He also derived a  , which made him a pioneer of economics. Copernicus' achievements and discoveries are considered the basis of Polish culture and cultural identity. \n Poland's tertiary education institutions; traditional  , as well as technical, medical, and economic institutions, employ around 61,000 researchers and members of staff.  There are around 300 research and development institutes, with about 10,000 researchers.  In total, there are around 91,000 scientists in Poland today.  However, in the 19th and 20th centuries many Polish scientists worked abroad; one of the most important of these exiles was  , a physicist and chemist who lived much of her life in France. In 1925 she established Poland's  . \n In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing centre of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the   (with  ,  ,  ,  ) and   (with  ,  ,   and  ).\n Over 40 research and development centers and 4,500 researchers make Poland the biggest research and development hub in Central and Eastern Europe.  Multinational companies such as: ABB,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   all have set up research and development centres in Poland.  Companies chose Poland because of the availability of highly qualified labour force, presence of universities, support of authorities, and the largest market in East-Central Europe.  According to a   report from 2011, 80% of Poland's current investors are content with their choice and willing to reinvest. \n The public postal service in Poland is operated by   (the Polish Post). It was created on 18 October 1558, when King   established a permanent postal route from   to  .  The service was dissolved during the foreign partitions in the 18th century. After regaining independence in 1918, Poland's postal system developed rapidly as new services were introduced including  , payment of pensions, delivery of magazines, and  .  The government-owned enterprise of Polish Post, Telegraph and Telephone ( ) was established in 1928.\n During  , communication was provided mainly through the military authorities.

With an estimated number of around 83,000 employees (2013),    also has a personal tracking system for parcels. In 2017 the company adopted a strategy that assumes increasing revenues to 6.9 billion   by 2021; the aim is to double revenues from courier and parcel services and a five-fold growth in logistics services. \n Poland, with its 38,544,513 inhabitants, has the   and the sixth-largest in the  . It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometer (328 per square mile).\n In recent years, Poland's population has decreased due to an increase in emigration and a decline in the birth rate. Since  , a significant number of Poles  , primarily to the  ,   and   in search of better work opportunities abroad.  With better economic conditions and Polish salaries at 70% of the EU average in 2016, this trend started to decrease in the 2010s and workforce became needed in the country.\n As a result, the Polish Minister of Development   suggested that Poles abroad should return to Poland.  Polish minorities are still present in the neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries (see   for population numbers). Altogether, the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20\u00a0million.  The largest number of   can be found in the  ,  ,   and  .

The Commonwealth was primarily composed of three nations:  ,  , and   (Ukrainians and Belarusians) \u2014 there were also sizable minorities of groups such as Germans, Jews, Latvians,  ,  ,   and  .  After the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, the bulk of the ethnic Polish population was primarily located in  , and in the   and   provinces. When Poland regained its independence in 1918, Poles constituted the majority of the population in the country, during the  , with sizable Ukrainian, Belarusian, Jewish and German minorities. \n Today, Poland is primarily inhabited by ethnic Poles. In the  , 37,310,341 (96.88%) reported   as their first identity, 435,750 (1.13%)  , 17,746 (0.04%)  , 74,464 (0.19%)  , 38,387 (0.09%)  , and 36,399 (0.09%)  .   were reported by 88,577 people (0.23%) and 521,470 people (1.35%) did not report any identity.

The persistence was demonstrated by a series of rebellions known as the   in the first half of the 11th century, which also showed elements of a peasant uprising against landowners and feudalism,  and led to a mutiny that destabilized the country. \n Since then, Poland has been a predominantly Catholic nation, however throughout its history, religious tolerance was an important part of the political culture. In 1264, the  , also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted   living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the  , outlawing early Protestant  . Then in 1573, the   marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The act was not imposed by a king or consequence of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of the Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the events of the 1572 French  , which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such reprehensible atrocities in Poland. The act is also credited with keeping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of the  , fought between German Protestants and Catholics. \n Religious tolerance in Poland spurred many theological movements such as Calvinist   and a number of other Protestant groups, as well as atheists, such as ex-Jesuit philosopher  , one of the first atheist thinkers in Europe.

Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in larger cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, Warsaw. However, all   have their own general hospital (most have more than one), all of which are obliged to have a trauma centre; these types of hospital, which are able to deal with almost all medical problems are called 'regional hospitals'  . The last category of hospital in Poland is that of specialised medical centres, an example of which would be the  , Poland's leading, and most highly specialised centre for the research and treatment of cancer.\n In 2012, the Polish health-care industry experienced further transformation. Hospitals were given priority for refurbishment where necessary.  As a result of this process, many hospitals were updated with the latest medical equipment.\n In 2016, the average life expectancy at birth was 77.6 years (73.7 years for infant male and 81.7 years for infant female). \n The   ( ) established in 1773, was the world's first state ministry of education.  The education of Polish society was a goal of the nation's rulers as early as the 12th century. The library catalogue of the   of Krak\u00f3w dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th century Polish academia had access to European and Classical literature.

Corporal punishment of children in schools is officially prohibited since 1783 (before the partitions) and criminalised since 2010 (in schools as well as at home).\n At the end of the 6th class when students are 13, students take a compulsory exam that will determine their acceptance and transition into a specific lower secondary school ( \u2014middle school or junior high). They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a   or four years in a  . Both end with a maturity examination ( \u2014similar to French  ), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to   or in\u017cynier (the Polish   first cycle qualification),   (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification). \n In Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education.

The dynasty was considered   by historians until scientific excavations found early   sites at  , Henan in 1959.  It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period.  The succeeding   is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records.  The Shang ruled the plain of the   in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century\u00a0 .

The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and   system, constructed the  , and patronized  . However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a   in   provoked widespread unrest. \n Under the succeeding   and   dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age.  The Tang Empire returned control of the   and the Silk Road,  brought traders to as far as   and the  ,  and made the capital   a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the   in the 8th century.  In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the   in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and  . The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese   to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade. \n Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a  , in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,  and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as   and   were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity.

A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the   as the  . Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral   led the   throughout the  , reaching as far as  . \n In the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from   to Beijing.

The centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on   with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, the   (\"sea ban\"), and ideological control as represented by the  , causing social and technological stagnation.  In the mid-19th century, the dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the   with Britain and France.

The   (1894\u201395) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the  , as well as the cession of Taiwan to  . \n The Qing dynasty also began experiencing   in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the  , the failed   that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the   (1862\u201377) in the northwest. The initial success of the   of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.\n In the 19th century, the great   began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the  , in which between 9 and 13 million people died.  The   drafted a   in 1898 to establish a modern  , but these plans were thwarted by the  . The ill-fated anti-foreign   of 1899\u20131901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the   of 1911\u201312 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the  .\n On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and   of the   (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president.  However, the presidency was later given to  , a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself  . In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own  , he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic. \n After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory.  In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under  , the then Principal of the  , was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings, known collectively as the  .  The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to   and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's   program for transforming China into a modern democratic state.  The   in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the     (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the  . This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in the  , until Japanese aggression and the 1936   forced Chiang to confront  . \n The   (1937\u20131945), a   of  , forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the PLA.

In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.  The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex  .\n A major environmental issue in China is the continued  , particularly the Gobi Desert.  Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of  , prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in   plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of east Asia, including Korea and Japan. China's environmental watchdog,  , stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000\u00a0km  (1,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) per year to desertification.

And China is the country with the highest death toll because of air pollution. There are 1.14 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution.  China is the  .  The country also has significant   problems: 40% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011.  In 2014, the internal freshwater resources per capita of China reduced to 2,062m , and it was below 500m  in the  , while 5,920m  in the world. \n In China, heavy metals also cause environmental pollution. Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure. The total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water, waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005\u20132011. \n However, China is the world's leading investor in   and  , with  52\u00a0billion invested in 2011 alone;  it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.  By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from  : a total installed capacity of 197 GW makes China the   in the world.  China also has the largest power capacity of   and   in the world.  In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan (US$619 billion) in water infrastructure and   projects over a ten-year period, and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by 2020.  In 2013, China began a five-year, US$277 billion effort to reduce air pollution, particularly in the north of the country. \n The People's Republic of China is the   country in the world by land area  after  , and is the third largest by total area, after Russia and Canada.  China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000\u00a0km  (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).  Specific area figures range from 9,572,900\u00a0km  (3,696,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the  ,  to 9,596,961\u00a0km  (3,705,407\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,  and the  . \n China has the  , measuring 22,117\u00a0km (13,743\u00a0mi) from the mouth of the   (Amnok River) to the  .  China  ,   except Russia, which also borders 14.  China extends across much of East Asia, bordering  ,  , and   in Southeast Asia;  ,  ,  ,  , and   in South Asia;  ,   and   in Central Asia; and  ,  , and   in   and  . Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with  ,  ,  , and the  .\n  states that The People's Republic of China \"is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants,\" and that the state organs \"apply the principle of democratic centralism.\"  The PRC is one of the world's only    . The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as authoritarian and  ,  with heavy restrictions in many areas, most notably against  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  .  Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as the \" \", \" \" (which is   adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the \" \" respectively. \n Since 2018, the main body of the   declares that \"the defining feature of   is the leadership of the   (CPC).\"  The 2018 amendments constitutionalized the     status of China,  wherein the   ( ) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the  .  The   is pyramidal. Local People's Congresses are  , and higher levels of People's Congresses up to the   (NPC) are   by the People's Congress of the level immediately below.  The political system is decentralized, and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy.   , have representatives in the NPC and the   (CPPCC).  China supports the Leninist principle of \" \",  but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a \" \" body. \n The   is the titular  , elected by the  . The   is the  , presiding over the   composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions. The incumbent president is  , who is also the   and the  , making him China's  . The incumbent premier is  , who is also a senior member of the  , China's   top decision-making body. \n There have been some moves toward political liberalization, in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels.  However, the party retains effective control over government appointments: in the absence of meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default most of the time. Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.  Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80\u201395% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 survey. \n The People's Republic of China is divided into 22  , five   (each with a designated minority group), and four  \u2014collectively referred to as \" \"\u2014as well as the   (SARs) of   and  . Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .\n China considers   to be  , although Taiwan is governed by the   (ROC), which rejects the PRC's claim.  Conversely, the ROC claims sovereignty over all divisions governed by the PRC.\n The PRC has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and maintains  . Its   is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous  . In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the  .  China was also a former member and leader of the  , and still considers itself an advocate for  .  Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the   group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's   at  ,   in April 2011. \n Under its interpretation of the  , Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,  especially in the matter of armament sales. \n Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier  's  , and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.  This policy may have led China to support states that are   or repressive by Western nations, such as  ,   and  .  China has a   with Russia,  and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council. \n China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013, as measured by the sum of imports and exports.  By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries.  In 2017, China exported $2.26 trillion in goods while it imported $1.84 trillion.  In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for   and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. China became a member of the   (WTO) on 11 December 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new   (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.  The EAS, which includes  , India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the   (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics.\n China has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the   approved \"permanent normal trade relations\" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.  China has a significant   with the United States, its most important export market.  In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that the   was significantly undervalued, giving China an unfair trade advantage. \n Since the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of   for trade and bilateral co-operation;  in 2012, Sino-African trade totalled over US$160 billion.  China maintains healthy and highly diversified trade links with the European Union. China has furthermore strengthened its ties with major South American economies, becoming the largest trading partner of Brazil and building strategic links with Argentina. \n China's   has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of 2019, includes 137 countries and 30 international organizations. \n Ever since its establishment after the second  , the PRC has claimed   governed by the   (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the   as its  ,   and   as a part of   and islands the ROC controls in the   as a part of   and  . These claims are controversial because of the complicated  , with the PRC treating the   as one of its most important diplomatic principles. \n In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a   and an undefined border with  . China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the   and the  .  On 21 May 2014  , speaking at a conference in Shanghai, pledged to settle China's territorial disputes peacefully. \"China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests\", he said. \n China is regularly hailed as a  ,  with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress, growing military might, very large population, and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a   in the 21st century.  Others, however, warn that   and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China's growth as the century progresses. \nSome authors also question the definition of \"superpower\", arguing that China's large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower, and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the United States.  Others \u2014 namely,   \u2014 have argued that China's investment in renewable energy has positioned it to be a likely superpower in that area, especially due to a shift in global trade relations. \n The  , social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s,   is still tightly restricted. The   states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include  ,  , the  ,  ,  , and  . However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.  Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling   are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet,  are routinely used to prevent collective action.  By 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal \"Social Credit\" score based on how they behave.  The  , now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of   which uses   technology.  In 2005,   ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index, which indicates a very low level of press freedom.  In 2014, China ranked 175th out of 180 countries. \n Rural migrants to China's cities often find themselves treated as   by the     system, which controls access to  .  Property rights are often poorly protected,  However, a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s, and additional social services provided to rural dwellers. \n A number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and   also routinely criticize  , alleging widespread   violations such as detention without trial,  ,  forced confessions,  , restrictions of fundamental rights,  and  .  The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the  .\n  was first taught publicly in 1992. In 1999, when there were about 70 million practitioners,  the   began, resulting in mass arrests, extralegal detention, and alleged reports of torture and deaths in custody.  The Chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in   and  , including violent police crackdowns and  .  At least one million members of     minority have been detained in mass  , termed \" \", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.  The camps were established under    's  .  In January 2019 the United Nations asked for direct access to the detention camps after a panel said it had received \u201ccredible reports\u201d that 1.1 million Uygur, Kazakhs, Hui and other ethnic minorities had been detained in  .  The state has even sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang, intimidating foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members. \n The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights, and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present level of  .  It emphasizes the rise in the Chinese  ,  , and average   since the 1970s, as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial   floods.  Furthermore, some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization, although  .  Some major reform efforts have been conducted. For instance, in November 2013 the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized   program,  although human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic.  During the 2000s and early 2010s, the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical, efficient solutions to social problems, but such \"third sector\" activity remained heavily regulated.  After   succeeded   in 2012, human rights in China have become worse. \n The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people were living in \"conditions of modern  \", or 0.25% of the population, including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. All except the last category are illegal. The state-imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013 but it is not clear the extent to which its various practices have stopped.  The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps, which fall under the heading   (\"reform through labor\"). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labour prisons and camps, known collectively as the Laogai.  Prisoners are not paid at all, and need their families to send money to them. Prisoners who refuse to work are beaten, and some are beaten to death. Many of the prisoners are political or religious dissidents, and some are recognized internationally as prisoners of conscience. A Chinese leader said that they want to see two products coming out of the prisons: the man who has been reformed, and the product made by the man.  , himself a former prisoner of the Laogai, filmed undercover footage of the Laogai, and was charged with stealing state secrets. For this,   was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but only served 66 days before being deported to the United States. \n In 2019 a world-first study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on  , because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners. The study was published in the medical journal BMJ Open. A report published in 2016 found a large discrepancy between official transplant figures from the Chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals. While the government says 10,000 transplants occur each year, hospital data shows between 60,000 and 100,000 organs are transplanted each year. The report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed  . \n With 2.3 million active troops, the   (PLA) is the largest standing military force in the world, commanded by the   (CMC).  China has the second-biggest military reserve force, only behind  . The PLA consists of the   (PLAGF), the   (PLAN), the   (PLAAF), and the   (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2017 totalled US$151.5 billion, constituting the  , although the   with 1.3% of GDP is below world average.  However, many authorities \u2013 including   and the U.S.   \u2013 argue that China does not report its real level of military spending, which is allegedly much higher than the official budget. \n As a recognized   state, China is considered both a major regional military power and a  .  According to a 2013 report by the  , China fields between 50 and 75 nuclear  , along with a number of  .  However, compared with the other four   Permanent Members, China has relatively limited   capabilities.  To offset this, it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s \u2013 its   entered service in 2012,  and it maintains a substantial fleet of  , including several     and   submarines.  China has furthermore established a  . \n China has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades, purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the  , and also manufacturing its own modern fighters, most notably the  ,   and the  ,  ,  , and  .  China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous   and numerous  .    and   weaponry advances have increased the regional threat from the perspective of Japan as well as Washington.  China has also updated its ground forces, replacing its ageing  -derived   inventory with numerous variants of the modern  , and upgrading its battlefield   and   systems to enhance its   capabilities.  In addition, China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems,  including  ,    and submarine-launched nuclear ICBMs.  According to the  's data, China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010\u201314, an increase of 143 percent from the period 2005\u201309.  Chinese officials stated that spending on the military will rise to U.S. $173B in 2018.  In the period of 2014-2018, China was the fifth largest exporter of major arms in the world, with an increase of 2.7% compared to the previous period. \nIn August 2018, China tested its first  . The China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA) claims to have successfully conducted the test with the aircraft Starry Sky-2 that touched a speed of   6 \u2013 which is six times the speed of sound, that can carry nuclear missiles. \n As of 2018, China had   in terms of nominal GDP, totaling approximately US$13.5 trillion (90 trillion Yuan).  In terms of   (PPP GDP), China's economy has been the largest in the world since 2014, according to the World Bank.  According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $13.6 trillion by 2018.  China's economic growth has been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of  .  China is also the world's   and   of goods.  Between 2010 and 2019, China's contribution to global GDP growth has been 25% to 39%. \n China had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.  Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world\u2014Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen\u2014that together have a market capitalization of over $10 trillion, as of 2019. \n China has been the world's #1 manufacturer since 2010, after overtaking the US, which had been #1 for the previous hundred years.  China has also been #2 in high-tech manufacturing since 2012, according to US  .  China is the second largest retail market in the world, next to the United States.  China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for 40% of the global market share in 2016  and more than 50% of the global market share in 2019.  China is the world's leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world in 2018.  China had 174 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018, which amounts to more than 40% of the global solar capacity. \n China has been   in terms of nominal GDP since 2010.  In terms of   (PPP) GDP, China's economy has been the largest in the world since 2014.  As of 2018, China was second in the world in total number of billionaires and millionaires\u2014there were 338 Chinese billionaires  and 3.5 million millionaires.  However, it ranks behind over 70 countries (out of around 180) in per capita economic output, making it a middle income country.  Additionally, its development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions.  China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history \u2014between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China reduced the extreme poverty rate\u2014per international standard, it refers to an income of less than $1.90/day\u2014from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013.  According to the World Bank, the number of Chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013.  China's own national poverty standards are higher and thus the national poverty rates were 3.1% in 2017  and 1% in 2018. \n In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by  .  In other words, as of 2019, 100 million Chinese are in the Top 10% of the wealthiest individuals in the world \u2014those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000.\n From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally  . Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the  ,   and the new Chinese leadership began to   and move towards a more market-oriented   under one-party rule.   was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of   (SEZs). Inefficient   (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,  and is one of the leading examples of  .  The state still dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and  , but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30\u00a0million private businesses recorded in 2008.  In 2018, private enterprises in China accounted for 60% of GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs. \n In 2015, China's Middle Class became the largest in the world.  By 2019, there were more Chinese than Americans in the richest 10% of the people in the world.  Since economic liberalization began in 1978, China has been among the world's fastest-growing economies,  relying originally on investment- and export-led growth, but now shifting more to consumption.  In 2018, 76% of growth in China's GDP came from consumption.  According to the IMF, China's   between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5%. In the years immediately following the financial crisis of 2007, China's economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the   countries' growth combined.  According to the   index announced by   in February 2011, China has a very high 3G growth rating.  Its high productivity, low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing.\n China ranks #1 in the production of steel, aluminum and automobiles\u2014China's global market shares are 50% in steel,  50% in aluminum  and 30% in automobile manufacturing.  China has also been increasingly turning to automation, becoming the world's largest market for industrial robots in 2013. Between 2010 and 2015, China installed 90,000 industrial robots, or one-third of the world's total.  In 2017, China bought 36% of all the new industrial robots in the world.  China's plan is to also domestically design and manufacture 100,000 industrial robots by 2020.  However, the Chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient;  China became the world's largest   in 2010,  relies on coal to supply over 70% of its energy needs, and surpassed the US to become the world's largest oil importer in 2013. \n In the last decade, China has become   in terms of installed solar power capacity, hydro-power and wind power. According to the  , China will account for 40% of the global renewable energy by 2022.  In addition, official GDP figures are seen as unreliable and there have been several well-publicized cases of data manipulation.  In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy.  China's GDP was smaller than Germany's in 2007; however, by 2017, China's $12.2 trillion-economy became larger than those of Germany, UK, France and Italy combined.  In 2018, the IMF reiterated its forecast that China will overtake the US in terms of nominal GDP by the year 2030.  Economists also expect China's middle class to expand to 600 million people by 2025. \n Tourism is a major contributor to the economy. In 2017, this sector contributed about CNY 8.77 trillion (US$1.35 trillion), 11.04% of the GDP, and contributed direct and indirect employment of up to 28.25 million people. There were 139.48 million inbound trips and five billion domestic trips.  China is now #1 in the number of skyscrapers (buildings taller than 200m), accounting for about 50% of world's total.  In four years\u20142015 through 2018\u2014China built 310 skyscrapers, while the corresponding number for the US was 33. \n China is one of the world's most technologically advanced nations.  It is the world's largest e-commerce market, amounting to 42% of the global market by 2016   and is expected to account for 55% of global e-commerce retail sales in 2019 (more than three times as large as the US market).  China's e-commerce market had online sales of more than $1 trillion in 2018, according to   and is expected to be just under $2 trillion in 2019.  China's   industry took off in 2009, marked by the growth of internet giants   and   \u2013 purveyors of products such as   and   \u2013 that have become ubiquitous in contemporary Chinese life. Tencent's   and Alibaba's   have helped China become a world leader in mobile payments, which amounted to about $30 trillion in China in 2017 and more than $40 trillion in 2018. \n China is also second only to the United States in   activity and is home to a large number of   startup companies.  In 2018, China attracted $105 billion of venture capital investments, amounting to 38% of global VC investments that year.  In late 2018, the world's most valuable startup was  , a Chinese company;  and the two most valuable   (AI) startups in the world were   and Face++, both from China.  In 2017, China's State Council released its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which declared AI technology a priority economic growth and investment sector.  In 2018, China created 97 \"unicorns\" \u2013 startups that are worth more than $1 billion \u2013 which amounted to 1 unicorn every 3.8 days.  Chinese smartphone brands \u2013  ,  ,  ,  ,   etc. \u2013 have captured more than 40% of the global market.  By 2019, Huawei had become the world's largest telecom infrastructure provider, surpassing   and  , and had taken the lead in   technology.  The company also entered the consumer   and   services markets,  and is the world's third-largest smartphone company, after   and  . \n Other Chinese tech giants include DJI (world's largest drone maker with 70% market share),  BOE (world's largest flat-panel display maker),   Didi (world's largest and most valuable ride-sharing company)  and BYD (world's largest plug-in vehicle maker\u2014including both BEV and PHEV)  China also the most number of supercomputers\u2014227 out of the Top 500 (as of 2019). \n China is also the world leader in patents, accounting for 1.54 million patents or almost half of all global patents in 2018.  China's spending on R&D has been growing rapidly in the last decade, amounting to $277 billion in 2017. \n China is a member of the   and is the world's largest trading power, with a total international trade value of US$4.62\u00a0trillion in 2018.    reached US$3.1\u00a0trillion as of 2019,  making its reserves by far the world's largest.  In 2012, China was the world's largest recipient of inward   (FDI), attracting $253 billion.  In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world.  China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $62.4\u00a0billion in 2012,  and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies.  China is a major owner of  , holding trillions of dollars worth of U.S.  .  China's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies,  and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of   goods. \n China ranks 17th in the world in Global Innovation Index, not too far from the US, which ranks 6th.  China ranks 27th out of 137 countries in the 2017-2018  ,  above many advanced economies and making it by far the most competitive major emerging economy. This is largely owing to its strength in infrastructure and wide adoption of communication and information technology. However, it lags behind advanced economies in labor market efficiency, institutional strength, and openness of market competition, especially for foreign players attempting to enter the domestic market.  In 2018,  s   list of the world's largest corporations included  .  Many of the largest   in the world were Chinese, including the  , the  . \n Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. Dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.  To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the  . In 2008, China established   market and expanded the Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity.  This was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia,   ,   ,   ,  the  ,  and  .  As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world, an emerging international  ,  and a component of the IMF's  ; however, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, Dollar and Japanese Yen in international trade volumes. \n China has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015,  and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018.  China's middle-class population (if defined as those with annual income of between US$10,000 and US$60,000) had reached more than 300\u00a0million by 2012.  Wages in China have grown exponentially in the last 40 years\u2014real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007.  By 2018, median wages in Chinese cities such as Shanghai were about the same as or higher than the wages in Eastern European countries.  More than 75 percent of China's urban consumers are expected to earn between 60.000 and 229.000 RMB per year by 2022.  China has the world's second-highest number of billionaires, with nearly 400 as of 2018, increasing at the rate of roughly two per week.  China's domestic retail market was worth over 20 trillion yuan (US$3.2 trillion) in 2012  and is growing at over 12% annually as of 2013 ,  while the country's luxury goods market has expanded immensely, with 27.5% of the global share.  However, in recent years, China's rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation,  leading to increased government regulation.  China has a high level of economic inequality,  which has increased in the past few decades.  In 2012, China's official   was 0.474.  A study conducted by   showed that China's Gini coefficient actually had reached 0.61 in 2012, and top 1% Chinese held more than 25% of China's wealth.  By 2015, China's GINI index had fallen to 0.38, according to World Bank. \n China was once a world leader in science and technology up until the  .  Ancient   and  , such as  ,  , the  , and   (the  ), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use  .  By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement.  The causes of this early modern   continue to be debated by scholars to this day. \n After repeated   by the European colonial powers and   in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the  . After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the  , in which scientific research was part of central planning.  After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the  ,  and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed. \n Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research  and is quickly catching up with the US in R&D spending.  In 2017, China spent $279 billion on scientific research and development.  According to  , China spent 2.11% of its GDP on Research and Development (R&D) in 2016.  Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as \"techno-nationalism\".  Nonetheless, China's investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the United States and Japan.  According to the US  , China had, for the first time, more science and engineering publications than the US, in 2016.  Also, in 2016, China spent $409 billion (by PPP) on Research and Development.  In 2018, China is estimated to have spent $475 billion (by PPP), second only to the USA.  In 2017, China was #2 in international patents application, behind the US but ahead of Japan.  Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE were the top 2 filers of international patents in 2017.  Chinese-born scientists have won the   four times, the   and   once respectively, though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel-winning research in western nations. \n China is developing its education system with an emphasis on  ; in 2009, China graduated over 10,000 Ph.D. engineers, and as many as 500,000   graduates, more than any other country.  In 2016, there were 4.7 million STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates in China, which was more than eight times the corresponding number for the US.  China also became the world's largest publisher of   by 2016.  Chinese technology companies such as   and   have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing,  and Chinese   are consistently ranked among the  .  China is also expanding its use of industrial  ; from 2008 to 2011, the installation of multi-role robots in Chinese factories rose by 136 percent.  China has been the world's largest market for industrial robots since 2013 and will account for 45% of newly installed robots from 2019-2021. \n The   is one of the world's most active, and is a major source of national pride.  In 2018, China successfully launched more satellites (35) than any other country, including the USA (30).  In 1970, China launched its first satellite,  , becoming the fifth country to do so independently.  In 2003, China became the third country to independently send humans into space, with  's spaceflight aboard  ; as of 2015 ,   have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China's first space station module,  , was launched, marking the first step in a project to assemble   by the early 2020s.  In 2013, China successfully landed the   lander and   rover onto the lunar surface.  In 2016, China's 2nd space station module,  , was launched from\u00a0 \u00a0aboard a\u00a0 \u00a0rocket on 15 September 2016. Then  \u00a0successfully docked with Tiangong-2 on 19 October 2016. In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe\u2014 \u2014on the far side of the moon.\n A 2016 report by   consulting group, revealed that China has been annually spending more on infrastructure than North America and Western Europe combined. \n China is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the   of any country in the world, with over 1.5 billion subscribers, as of 2018.  It also has the world's largest number of   and  , with over 800 million Internet users as of 2018 \u2014equivalent to around 60% of its population\u2014and almost all of them being mobile as well.  Almost entire China's population had access to 4G network by 2017.  By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total.  In terms of unique mobile subscribers as percentage of population, China came in at 82%, placing the country #3 in the world (as of 2018).  As of early 2019, the average mobile connection speed in China was 30 Mbit/s (megabits per second),  which is 9% slower than the US.  As for fixed broadband in China, the average download speed was 76 Mbit/s;  and 60% of fixed broadband Chinese users (or 200 million Chinese households) were able to access the Internet at 100 Mbit/s or higher (as of 2018).  China is making rapid progress in 1 Gbit/s (1000 Mbit/s) internet, and 42% of Chinese homes are expected to have 1 Gbit/s broadband link by 2023.  In 2018, China had 378 million fixed broadband users and 87% of them were fiber-optic users, making China #1 in the world in deployment of fiber-optic cables for broadband.  By the end of 2017, China had 29 million kilometers of fiber-optic cable.  In 2019, China is expected to account for 24% of the world's spending on IoT or internet-connected devices.  Since 2011 China has been the nation with the most installed telecommunication bandwidth in the world. By 2014, China hosted more than twice as much national bandwidth potential than the U.S., the historical leader in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth (China: 29% versus US:13% of the global total).  China is making rapid advances in 5G\u2014by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.  In early 2019, Shanghai railway station introduced 5G WiFi that has an internet speed of 1,200 Mbit/s. \n ,   and  , are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the biggest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018.  Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China.  Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably   and  , have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.  British intelligence\u2014GCHQ and NCSC\u2014said in 2019 that there have been no evidence of malicious activity or spying by Huawei. \n China is developing its own   system, dubbed  , which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012  and it started providing global services by the end of 2018.  Now China belongs to the elite group of three countries\u2014US and Russia being the other two members\u2014that provide global satellite navigation.\n Since the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of   and  . In 2018,   had reached a total length of 142,500\u00a0km (88,500\u00a0mi), making it the  ;  and China's railways reached a total length of 127,000\u00a0km by 2017.  By the end of 2018, China's   network reached a length of 29,000\u00a0km, representing more than 60% of the world's total.  In 1991, there were only six bridges across the main stretch of the Yangtze River, which bisects the country into northern and southern halves. By October 2014, there were  .\nChina has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and  . Sales of passenger cars in 2016 exceeded 24\u00a0million.  A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents,  with   cited as a possible cause\u2014in 2011 alone, around 62,000 Chinese died in road accidents.  However, the Chinese government has taken a lot of steps to address this problem and has reduced the number of fatalities in traffic accidents by 20% from 2007 to 2017.  In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles \u2013 as of 2012 , there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China. \n , which are  , are among  , handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.  as of 2017 , the country had 127,000\u00a0km (78,914\u00a0mi) of railways, the  .  The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the   holiday, when the   takes place.  In 2013, Chinese railways delivered 2.106 billion passenger trips, generating 1,059.56 billion passenger-kilometers and carried 3.967 billion tons of freight, generating 2,917.4 billion cargo tons-kilometers. \n China's   started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2018,   had over 29,000 kilometers (18,020 miles) of dedicated lines alone, a length that exceeds rest of the world's high-speed rail tracks combined, making it the  .  With an annual ridership of over 1.1 billion passengers in 2015 it is the world's busiest.  The network includes the  , the single longest HSR line in the world, and the  , which has  .  The HSR track network is set to reach approximately 30,000\u00a0km (19,000\u00a0mi) by the end of 2019.  The  , which reaches 431\u00a0km/h (268\u00a0mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.  In May 2019, China released a prototype for a   high-speed train that would reach a speed of 600\u00a0km/hr (375\u00a0mph); and it is expected to go into commercial production by 2021.  \n Since 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated. As of January\u00a02016 , 26 Chinese cities have   in operation and 39 more have metro systems approved  with a dozen more to join them by 2020.  The  ,  ,  ,   and   are among the   and   in the world.\n There were   with around 240 planned by 2020. More than two-thirds of the airports under construction worldwide in 2013 were in China,  and   expects that China's fleet of active commercial aircraft in China will grow from 1,910 in 2011 to 5,980 in 2031.  In just five years\u2014from 2013 to 2018\u2014China bought 1000 planes from Boeing.  With rapid expansion in  , the   have also joined the ranks of the  . In 2018, Beijing's   ranked second in the world by   (it was 26th in 2002). Since 2010, the   and   have ranked first and third in  .\n Some 80% of China's airspace remains restricted for  , and   made up eight of the 10 worst-performing Asian airlines in terms of delays. \nChina has over 2,000  , about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping. In 2017, the Ports of  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   ranked in the Top 10 in the world   and  . \n Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as  .  According to data presented by the   of   and   in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to  .  In June 2010, there were 1,519   in China and 18 plants were added each week.  The ongoing   intends to abate water shortage in the north. \n The   recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old.  The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.  China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle class.  Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has  \u2014800 million, to be more precise \u2014of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981.  China's own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019.  From 2009\u20132018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%. \n Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.  In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a  .  Data from the 2010 census implies that the   may be around 1.4, although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5\u20131.6. \n According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth  or the size of the total population.  However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction. \n The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the   at birth.  According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls,  which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls.  The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population.  However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population. \n China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the  . The largest of these nationalities are the ethnic Chinese or \"Han\", who constitute more than 80% of the total\npopulation.  The Han Chinese \u2013 the world's largest single ethnic group  \u2013 outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except   and  .  Ethnic minorities account for about less than 25% of the population of China, according to\nthe 2010 census.  Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%.  The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign nationals living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the\nUnited States (71,493) and Japan (66,159). \n There are as many as 292   in China.  The languages most commonly spoken belong to the   of the   family, which contains   (spoken by 70% of the population),  and   of  :   (including   and  ),   (including   and  ),   (including  ,   and  ),  ,   and  .

The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 55% in 2016.  It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population.  As of 2012 , there are more than 262\u00a0million   in China, mostly rural migrants seeking work in cities. \n China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,  including the seven   (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Wuhan.  By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.  The figures in the table below are from the 2010 census,  and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large \" \" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;  the figures below include only long-term residents.\n Since 1986, compulsory education in China comprises   and  , which together last for nine years.  In 2010, about 82.5 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school.  The  , China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. In 2010, 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in higher education.  This number increased significantly over the last years, reaching a tertiary school enrollment of 48.4 percent in 2016.  Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and   level. \n In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees.  Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$250 billion in 2011.  However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled \u00a520,023, while in  , one of the  , only totalled \u00a53,204.  Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2011, around 81.4% of Chinese have received secondary education.  By 2007, there were 396,567 primary schools, 94,116 secondary schools, and 2,236 higher education institutions in China. \n As of 2010 , 94% of the population over age 15 are literate.  In 1949, only 20% of the population could read, compared to 65.5% thirty years later.  In 2009, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the   (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance.  Despite the high results, Chinese education has also faced   for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas. \n The  , together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population.  An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the  , which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as  ,   and  , which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly  , and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.  By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.  In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of  , but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of  . \n As of 2012 , the average life expectancy at birth in China is 75 years,  and the   rate is 12 per thousand.  Both have improved significantly since the 1950s.  Rates of  , a condition caused by  , have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.  Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by  ,  hundreds of millions of  ,  and an increase in   among urban youths.  China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of  , although this has since been largely contained.  In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China. \n Religion in China (  2014) \n The government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses  ,  and has conducted   to this end.  Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the  .    is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution. \n Over the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \" \", including  ,  , and   ( ), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture,  enriching a   which harkens back to the early   and  . Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions,  consists in allegiance to the   ( ), a character that signifies the \" \", who can be   of the environment or   of human groups, concepts of civility,  , many of whom feature in   and history.  Among the most popular   are those of   (goddess of the seas),    (one of the two   of the Chinese race),    (god of war and business),   (god of prosperity and richness),   and many others. China is home to many of the  , including the tallest of all, the   in  .\n Clear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of \"religion\" and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between   religions and local folk religious practice.  A 2015 poll conducted by   found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\",  though it is worthwhile to note that Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as   and   religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.  According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practise Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including   and  .  In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various   who maintain their  . The various folk religions today comprise 2\u20133% of the population, while Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include   and the   of the  ,  ,  ,   and other peoples in Northwest China.\n Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by  . For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious  , which have their origins in the  .  The   of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that  ,   and   were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.  Examinations and a   remain greatly valued in China today. \n The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the   and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure,  , and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the   of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as \"regressive and harmful\" or \"vestiges of  \".
